# LocationV-lo
Here is a project that I was able to finish in school. This project is divides into two different applications, one in C# and the other in PHP. The first folder named PPE3_VELIB is a project with an architecture MVC in PHP. 
The other one named PPE3_Veliberte is a project in C#. This two folders are linked to a database in SQL with phpmyadmin.
